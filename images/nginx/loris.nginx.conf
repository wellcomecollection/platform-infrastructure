    # Requests for iiif.wellcomecollection.org/image should be forwarded to our IIIF Image API, Loris
    #
    # Wellcome Collection V images are currenly hosted in an s3 bucket and
    # they are sharded based on their file name, so we need to construct the image path in
    # the s3 bucket when we send the request to the iiif image API.
    #
    # File names start with V and are followed by 7 digits. The name of the directory in which each
    # file is stored is based on the first 4 digits of its filename.
    # For example V0002007.jpg is actually stored in V0002000/V0002007.jpg in the s3 bucket.
    # Therefore every request for V0002007.jpg needs to be routed to s3:V0002000/V0002007.jpg
