  # This runs the Lambda at 8am UTC on the second Tuesday of every month.
  # (3#2 = day 3 of the week / Tuesday, 2nd instance of)
  # See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-create-rule-schedule.html
  #
  # We run at this time reasons:
  #
  #   - We don't want to run on the 1st of the month because billing data
  #     can take a few days to consolidate.  In particular, some charges
  #     don't appear immediately.  This makes the bill look smaller than it
  #     actually is.  A short delay between the end of the month and running
  #     the billing report means the data should be correct.
  #
  #   - We have planning meetings on Tuesdays, so if this report does turn
  #     up anything worth investigation, we can discuss it at planning.
